I would just like to state that I am not the best at English, so if there are spelling, grammatical errors, or mistakes, please bear with me.

# Design

## Wireframes

I cerated my wireframes by hand.

Index Page

![Wireframe one](assets/Image-README/index.jpg)

Gallery Page

![Wireframe two](assets/Image-README/gallery.jpg)

Sign up Page

![Wireframe three](assets/Image-README/signup.jpg)

Mobile view

![Wireframe four](assets/Image-README/mobile.jpg)

I replaced my footer with other icons with a hover effect and added some more web links.
It has Lato text on the pages in white, which makes it easier to read. I wanted the colors I chose to fit in with the color scheme of the pictures.

## Colour Platte

The colour palette was sourced from [coolors](https://coolors.co/).
I chose colors inspired by woodworking.
![Colour Pallette](assets/Image-README/colorpalette.png)

#FFFFFF for text and icons

#7D5555 for background, footer and navbar

#FF7F50 for footer weblinks icons background

#E11D74 for instrgram weblink

#FF0000 for youtube weblink

#0000FF for weblink icons and facebook weblink

#00ADB5 for twitter weblink

#04009A for linkdin weblink

#000000 for github weblink

## Typography
I've integrated [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to find a typeface that complements the website's aesthetic. For the main text, I've chosen Lato due to its optimization for readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading environments.

 
## Imagery

All imagery for the website has been sourced from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/), which is a free photo stock platform. I specifically wanted to show imagery of all the stages of woodworking so the audience could get an understanding of the homepage.

# Features

## Languages  Used
- HTML 
- CSS

## Navigation Bar

This is included on all three pages and provides an easy structure for the audience to be able to use.![navigation bar](assets/Image-README/navbar.png) This is a responsive feature and remains this way until 768px and down, where the navigation bar moves under the logo! ![navigation bar](assets/Image-README/navbarlogo.png), so the design of both of these features isn't compromised. When pressing the navbar logo, it moves the menu to the left side of the screen. ![navigation bar](assets/Image-README/navbaropen.png)



## Completed website

![landing page](assets/Image-README/indexpage.png)

The landing page is displayed above.

## Footer

![footer](assets/Image-README/footer.png)

The social links all sit within the footer, which you are able to click and they will take you to the intended social media platform. They have the hover effect that changes color to the pages color.
