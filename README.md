# Design

## Wireframes

I cerated my wireframes by hand

![Wireframe one](assets/Image-README/index.jpg)
![Wireframe two](assets/Image-README/gallery.jpg)
![Wireframe three](assets/Image-README/signup.jpg)

I replaced my footer with other icons with a hover effect and added some more web links.
Has Lato text on the pages in white color which makes it easier to read. I wanted the colors I chose to fit in with the color scheme of the pictures.

## Colour Platte

The colour palette was sourced from [coolors](https://coolors.co/).
I chose colors inspired from woodworking.
![Colour Pallette](assets/Image-README/colorpalette.png)

#FFFFFF for text and icons

#7D5555 for background, footer and navbar

#FF7F50 for footer weblinks icons background

#E11D74 for instrgram weblink

#FF0000 for youtube weblink

#0000FF for weblink icons and facebook weblink

#00ADB5 for twitter weblink

#04009A for linkdin weblink

#000000 for github weblink

## Typography
I've integrated [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to find a typeface that compliments the website's aesthetic. For the main text, I've chosen Lato due to its optimization for readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading environments.

 
## Imagery

All imagery for the website has been sourced from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) which are free photo stock platforms. I specifically wanted to show imagery of all the stages of woodworking, so the audience can get an understanding of the homepage.

# Features

## Languages  Used
- HTML 
- CSS

## Navigation Bar

This is included on all three pages and provides an easy structure for the audience to be able to use.![navigation bar](assets/Image-README/navbar.png) This is a responsive feature and remains this way, until 768px and down where the navigation bar moves under logo,![navigation bar](assets/Image-README/navbarlogo.png), so the design of both of these features isn't compromised. When pressing navbar logo it moves the menu to the left side of the screen. ![navigation bar](assets/Image-README/navbaropen.png)



## Completed website

![landing page]()

The landing page is displayed above.

## Footer

![footer](assets/Image-README/footer.png)

The social links all sit within the footer, which you are able to click and they will take you to the intended social media platform. They have the hover effect that changes color to the pages color.
