# Features
LANGUAGES  USED
- HTML 
- CSS

NAVIGATION BAR

This is included on all three pages and provides an easy structure for the audience to be able to use.![navigation bar](assets/Image-README/Navbar.png) This is a responsive feature and remains this way, until 768px and down where the navigation bar moves under logo,![navigation bar](assets/Image-README/NavbarLogo.png), so the design of both of these features isn't compromised.
